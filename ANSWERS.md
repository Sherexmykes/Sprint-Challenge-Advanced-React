- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
It allows us to methods from the Component Lifecycle.
- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
Constructor: It's purpose in React as one that serves the component up with the initial state data that it needs to have during initial render.

Render: It's there to return what your component will render to the screen.

ComponentDidMound: This performs any asynchronous actions inside of our componentDidMount function, especially when it comes to fetching data via HTTP.
- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
 So you don't use the same kind of hooks throughout you're application and to make them reusable
- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
Testing surfaces bugs faster, acts as a safety net when making changes or refactoring and allows us to trust the code.
